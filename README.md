## Introduction
This github repository consists of my academic research projects throughout the years, including in undergraduate (PFM folder) and graduate (ABPs folder) school. The former consists of a Bayesian statistics model I helped develop to simulate the fusion plasma properties of a reversed-field pinch plasma generator (the Madison Symmetric Torus or MST) in addition to programs to simulate and design x-ray detectors for measuring plasma properties that I developed and applied to design an x-ray detector that improves the measurements of other scientists by removing undesirable noise. This project heavily focused on model development, verification, and optimization. The latter is a collection of software and packages for simulating systems of active and passive Brownian particles in HOOMD-Blue using molecular dynamics simulations. This project heavily focused on data science and analysis, including both back-end development, with creating and manipulating databases, cleaning and wrangling data, writing algorithms to statistically analyze big data, and developing predictive models, and front-end development by designing intuitive visualizations. Please see the README.md provided in either project individually for more details. Finally, please see my personal_projects repository for projects to develop individual skills or njlauersdorf.github.io for my website development experience.
