abstract = {Recent studies of the phase diagram for spherical, purely repulsive, active particles established the existence of a transition from a liquid-like to a solid-like phase analogous to the one observed in colloidal systems at thermal equilibrium, in particular in two dimensions an intermediate hexatic phase is observed. Here, we present evidence that the active dense phases (solid, hexatic and liquid) exhibit interesting dynamical anomalies. First, we unveil the growth - with density and activity - of ordered domains where the particles' velocities align in parallel or vortex-like patches. Second, when activity is strong, the spatial distribution of kinetic energy becomes heterogeneous with high energy regions correlated to defects of the crystalline structure. This spatial heterogeneity is accompanied by temporal intermittency, with sudden peaks in the time-series of kinetic energy. The observed dynamical anomalies are not present in a dense equilibrium system and cannot be detected by considering only the structural properties of the system.},

abstract = {Minimal models of self-propelled particles with short-range volume exclusion interactions have been shown to exhibit the signatures of phase separation. Here I show that the observed interfacial stability and fluctuations in motility-induced phase separations (MIPS) can be explained by modeling the microscopic dynamics of the active particles in the interfacial region. In addition, I demonstrate the validity of the Gibbs-Thomson relationship in MIPS, which provides a functional relationship between the size of a condensed drop and its surrounding vapor concentration. As a result, the late-stage coarsening dynamics of MIPS at vanishing supersaturation follows the classic Lifshitz-Slyozov scaling law.},

abstract = {We investigate the phase behavior and kinetics of a monodisperse mixture of active (i.e., self-propelled) and passive isometric Brownian particles through Brownian dynamics simulations and theory. As in a purely active system, motility of the active component triggers phase separation into a dense and a dilute phase; in the dense phase, we further find active-passive segregation, with "rafts" of passive particles in a "sea" of active particles. We find that phase separation from an initially disordered mixture can occur with as little as 15{\%} of the particles being active. Finally, we show that a system prepared in a suitable fully segregated initial state reproducibly self-assembles an active "corona," which triggers crystallization of the passive core by initiating a compression wave. Our findings are relevant to the experimental pursuit of directed self-assembly using active particles.},

abstract = {The pressure of suspensions of self-propelled objects is studied theoretically and by simulation of spherical active Brownian particles (ABPs). We show that for certain geometries, the mechanical pressure as force/area of confined systems can be equally expressed by bulk properties, which implies the existence of a nonequilibrium equation of state. Exploiting the virial theorem, we derive expressions for the pressure of ABPs confined by solid walls or exposed to periodic boundary conditions. In both cases, the pressure comprises three contributions: the ideal-gas pressure due to white-noise random forces, an activity-induced pressure ("swim pressure"), which can be expressed in terms of a product of the bare and a mean effective particle velocity, and the contribution by interparticle forces. We find that the pressure of spherical ABPs in confined systems explicitly depends on the presence of the confining walls and the particle-wall interactions, which has no correspondence in systems with periodic boundary conditions. Our simulations of three-dimensional ABPs in systems with periodic boundary conditions reveal a pressure-concentration dependence that becomes increasingly nonmonotonic with increasing activity. Above a critical activity and ABP concentration, a phase transition occurs, which is reflected in a rapid and steep change of the pressure. We present and discuss the pressure for various activities and analyse the contributions of the individual pressure components.},

In this paper, we analyze the literature from the point of view of swarm engineering: we focus mainly on ideas and concepts that contribute to the advancement of swarm robotics as an engineering field and that could be relevant to tackle real-world applications. Swarm engineering is an emerging discipline that aims at defining systematic and well founded procedures for modeling, designing, realizing, verifying, validating, operating, and maintaining a swarm robotics system. We propose two taxonomies: in the first taxonomy, we classify works that deal with design and analysis methods; in the second taxonomy, we classify works according to the collective behavior studied.

@article{Caprini2021,
abstract = {Recently, it has been discovered that systems of active Brownian particles (APB) at high density organise their velocities into coherent domains showing large spatial structures in the velocity field. This collective behavior occurs spontaneously,i.e.is not caused by any specific interparticle force favoring the alignment of the velocities. This phenomenon was investigated in the absence of thermal noise and in the overdamped regime where inertial forces could be neglected. In this work, we demonstrate through numerical simulations and theoretical analysis that velocity alignment is a robust property of ABP and persists even in the presence of inertial forces and thermal fluctuations. We also show that a single dimensionless parameter, such as the P{\'{e}}clet number customarily employed in the description of self-propelled particles, is not sufficient to fully characterize this phenomenon either in the regimes of large viscosity or small mass. Indeed, the size of the velocity domains, measured through the correlation length of the spatial velocity correlation, remains constant when the swim velocity increases and decreases as the rotational diffusion becomes larger. We find that, contrary to the common belief, the spatial velocity correlation not only depends on inertia but is also non-symmetrically affected by mass and inverse viscosity variations. We conclude that in self-propelled systems, at variance with passive systems, variations in the inertial time (mass over solvent viscosity) and mass act as independent control parameters. Finally, we highlight the non-thermal nature of the spatial velocity correlations that are fairly insensitive both to solvent and active temperatures.},

We present a highly effective micromotor strategy for photocatalytic degradation of CBWA based on light-activated TiO2/Au/Mg microspheres that propel autonomously in natural water and obviate the need for external fuel, decontaminating reagent, or mechanical agitation. The activated TiO2/Au/Mg micromotors generate highly reactive oxygen species responsible for the efficient destruction of the cell membranes of the anthrax simulant Bacillus globigii spore, as well as rapid and complete in situ mineralization of the highly persistent organophosphate nerve agents into nonharmful products. The water-driven propulsion of the TiO2/Au/Mg micromotors facilitates efficient fluid transport and dispersion of the photogenerated reactive oxidative species and their interaction with the CBWA. Coupling of the photocatalytic surface of the micromotors and their autonomous water-driven propulsion thus leads to a reagent-free operation which holds a considerable promise for diverse "green" defense and environmental applications.},

The origin of the swim pressure is based upon the notion that an active body would swim away in space unless confined by boundaries - this confinement pressure is precisely the swim pressure. Here we give the micromechanical basis for the swim stress and use this new perspective to study self-assembly and phase separation in active soft matter. The swim pressure gives rise to a nonequilibrium equation of state for active matter with pressure-volume phase diagrams that resemble a van der Waals loop from equilibrium gas-liquid coexistence. Theoretical predictions are corroborated by Brownian dynamics simulations.

abstract = {Abstract.: A micron-sized droplet of bromine water immersed in a surfactant-laden oil phase can swim (S. Thutupalli, R. Seemann, S. Herminghaus, New J. Phys. 13 073021 (2011). The bromine reacts with the surfactant at the droplet interface and generates a surfactant mixture. It can spontaneously phase-separate due to solutocapillary Marangoni flow, which propels the droplet. We model the system by a diffusion-advection-reaction equation for the mixture order parameter at the interface including thermal noise and couple it to fluid flow. Going beyond previous work, we illustrate the coarsening dynamics of the surfactant mixture towards phase separation in the axisymmetric swimming state. Coarsening proceeds in two steps: an initially slow growth of domain size followed by a nearly ballistic regime. On larger time scales thermal fluctuations in the local surfactant composition initiates random changes in the swimming direction and the droplet performs a persistent random walk, as observed in experiments. Numerical solutions show that the rotational correlation time scales with the square of the inverse noise strength. We confirm this scaling by a perturbation theory for the fluctuations in the mixture order parameter and thereby identify the active emulsion droplet as an active Brownian particle.

abstract = {The theoretical understanding of active matter, which is driven out of equilibrium by directed motion, is still fragmental and model oriented. Stochastic thermodynamics, on the other hand, is a comprehensive theoretical framework for driven systems that allows to define fluctuating work and heat. We apply these definitions to active matter, assuming that dissipation can be modelled by effective non-conservative forces. We show that, through the work, conjugate extensive and intensive observables can be defined even in non-equilibrium steady states lacking a free energy. As an illustration, we derive the expressions for the pressure and interfacial tension of active Brownian particles. The latter becomes negative despite the observed stable phase separation. We discuss this apparent contradiction, highlighting the role of fluctuations, and we offer a tentative explanation.},

Particles undergoes continuous phase transition and these phase transitions demonstrate equilibrium-like coarsening analagous to equilibrium systems of mutually attracting particles. This phase transition is athermal as it cannot be described by an effective temperature. Contracicts expectation that increased activity suppresses phase separation/formation of aggregates. The solid-dense phase behaves like an active material with structural and transport properties not achievable traditionally, such as superdiffusive transport at intermediate time scales and a heterogeneous and dynamic stress distribution. This clustering begins at parameters for which collision time becomes shorter than rotational diffusion time.},

If density $\rho$ is a function of height h then the local free energy density differs from that of a homogeneous fluid by a term proportional to (d2$\rho$/dh2); the extra term arises from the energy not from the entropy (Section 5). He uses this result to show how $\rho$ varies with h (Section 6), how this variation leads to a stable minimum free energy (Section 7), and to calculate the capillary energy or surface tension $\sigma$ (Section 9). Near the critical point $\sigma$ varies as ($\tau$k-$\tau$)3/2, where $\tau$k is the critical temperature (Section 11). The paper closes with short discussions of the thickness of the surface layer (Section 12), of the difficulty of assuming that $\rho$ varies discontinuously with height (Section 14), and of the possible effect of derivatives of higher order than (d2$\rho$/dh2) on the free energy and surface tension (Section 15). {\textcopyright} 1979 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

Yet, a full understanding of strong glass formers that exhibit an Arrhenius dependence on temperature is still lacking. In this work, we have investigated the glassy dynamics of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgel particles of varied elasticity in dense aqueous suspensions, giving rise to a full spectrum of strong to fragile glass-forming behaviors. We have observed the dependence of particle motions and structural relaxation on particle volume fraction can be weakened by decreasing particle elasticity, due to particle deformation and the resulting interparticle elastic interaction upon intimate particle contacts at high particle concentration. Both measured $\alpha$-relaxation time scales and dynamic length scales for cooperative rearranging motions of microgels in suspensions show similarly dependence on particle volume fraction and elasticity, thereby quantifying the glass fragility of dense microgel suspension of varied particle elasticity.},

abstract = {Stochastic thermodynamics provides an important framework to explore small physical systems where thermal fluctuations are inevitable. In the studies of stochastic thermodynamics, some thermodynamic quantities, such as the trajectory work, associated with the complete Langevin equation (the Kramers equation) are often assumed to converge to those associated with the overdamped Langevin equation (the Smoluchowski equation) in the overdamped limit under the overdamped approximation. Nevertheless, a rigorous mathematical proof of the convergence of the work distributions to our knowledge has not been reported so far. Here we study the convergence of the work distributions explicitly. In the overdamped limit, we rigorously prove the convergence of the extended Fokker-Planck equations including work using a multiple timescale expansion approach. By taking the linearly dragged harmonic oscillator as an exactly solvable example, we analytically calculate the work distribution associated with the Kramers equation, and verify its convergence to that associated with the Smoluchowski equation in the overdamped limit. We quantify the accuracy of the overdamped approximation as a function of the damping coefficient. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate that the data of the work distribution of a levitated silica nanosphere agrees with the overdamped approximation in the overdamped limit, but deviates from the overdamped approximation in the low-damping case. Our work fills a gap between the stochastic thermodynamics based on the complete Langevin equation (the Kramers equation) and the overdamped Langevin equation (the Smoluchowski equation), and deepens our understanding of the overdamped approximation in stochastic thermodynamics.},

In experiments and large-scale simulations, however, more complex steady states are also seen, comprising a dynamic population of dense clusters in a sea of vapor, or dilute bubbles in a liquid. Here, we show that these microphase-separated states should emerge generically in active matter, without any need to invoke system-specific details. We give a coarse-grained description of them and predict transitions between regimes of bulk phase separation and microphase separation. We achieve these results by extending the $\phi$4 field theory of passive phase separation to allow for all local currents that break detailed balance at leading order in the gradient expansion. These local active currents, whose form we show to emerge from coarse graining of microscopic models, include a mixture of irrotational and rotational contributions and can be viewed as arising from an effective nonlocal chemical potential. Such contributions influence, and in some parameter ranges reverse, the classical Ostwald process that would normally drive bulk phase separation to completion.},

Evaluating a recent proposal for an intensive active swimming pressure, we demonstrate that the excess stress within the interface separating both phases is negative. The occurrence of a negative tension together with stable phase separation is a genuine nonequilibrium effect that is rationalized in terms of a positive stiffness, the estimate of which agrees excellently with the numerical data.

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the effects that density fluctuations in different regions of a liquid-vapor interface have on the interfacial thermodynamic and structural properties. The total volume V is divided into a square array of columns whose width is the order of the bulk correlation length. The canonical partition function is written as a sum of constrained partition functions, each describing a system with a given number of particles in each column. Changes in the occupation number of each column (i.e., density fluctuations) are related to changes in position of the local Gibbs dividing surface, and the free energy of such distortions of the Gibbs surface is estimated using macroscopic ideas similar to those used in the capillary wave theory of Buff, Lovett, and Stillinger. Corrections to the interface tension as calculated for a single column with periodic boundary conditions are given. We make a self-consistent choice of the column width which yields a scaling law originally proposed by Widom. Fluctuations in position of the local Gibbs surfaces of widely separated columns cause the total interface width to depend on the system size and strength of an external field while the local width in a single column is proportional to the bulk correlation length. These fluctuations also cause the very long-ranged correlations parallel to the interface predicted by Wertheim. Both the singlet and the pair distributions functions are calculated. An extension of Wertheim's analysis is given. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1977 American Institute of Physics.},

Here, we study the simplest model, an ideal gas of noninteracting active Brownian particles. While the mechanical pressure exerted onto confining walls has been linked to correlations between particles' positions and their orientations, we show that these correlations are entirely controlled by boundary effects. We also consider a definition of local pressure, which describes interparticle forces in terms of momentum exchange between different regions of the system. We present three pieces of analytical evidence which indicate that such a local pressure exists, and we show that its bulk value differs from the mechanical pressure exerted on the walls of the system. We attribute this difference to the fact that the local pressure in the bulk does not depend on boundary effects, contrary to the mechanical pressure. We carefully examine these boundary effects using a channel geometry, and we show a virial formula for the pressure correctly predicts the mechanical pressure even in finite channels. However, this result no longer holds in more complex geometries, as exemplified for a channel that includes circular obstacles.},

abstract = {The capillary wave method is a well-known classical technique to measure surface tension and surface rheological properties. Despite the large number of theoretical works devoted to capillary waves, this technique has serious difficulties associated with its implementation, and therefore, it is not widely used by researchers. In this paper, we introduce our modifications of the existing method to overcome its drawbacks. First, a capillary wave is excited by pressure fluctuations generated locally at the interface. Being contactless, the proposed method is suitable for any liquid irrespective of its electrical properties. Second, the application of optical interferometry together with the spatial phase shifting method allows to quantify the surface profile with high accuracy. A new data processing algorithm makes it possible to subtract the parasitic deformation of the surface caused by external perturbations avoiding, thereby the thorough vibroisolation procedure. The relative error for surface measurements and surface tension calculations is 0.3{\%}. The results of surface tension measurements of several liquids obtained by the modified method are in good agreement with the data determined by the Wilhelmy plate technique. The main advantage of our method is that is well suited for measurements of low liquid volumes, which makes it of particular interest in biological and chemistry applications. Additionally, our version of the examined method allows one to extend the frequency range to 103-104 Hz, where only the quasi-elastic light scattering technique is currently applicable.},

It is normalized so that the conventional description of surface tension on an interface is recovered when the ratio of local transition region thickness to local radius of curvature approaches zero. The continuum method eliminates the need for interface reconstruction, simplifies the calculation of surface tension, enables accurate modeling of two- and three-dimensional fluid flows driven by surface forces, and does not impose any modeling restrictions on the number, complexity, or dynamic evolution of fluid interfaces having surface tension.

We are able to demonstrate equivalent or superior scaling on up to 3375 GPUs in Lennard-Jones and dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations of up to 108 million particles. GPUDirect RDMA capabilities in recent GPU generations provide better performance in full double precision calculations.

abstract = {The first example of a self-propelled tubular motor that releases an enzyme for the efficient biocatalytic degradation of chemical pollutants is demonstrated. How the motors are self-propelled by the Marangoni effect, involving simultaneous release of SDS surfactant and the enzyme remediation agent (laccase) in the polluted sample, is illustrated. The movement induces fluid convection and leads to the rapid dispersion of laccase into the contaminated solution and to a dramatically accelerated biocatalytic decontamination process. The greatly improved degradation efficiency, compared to quiescent solutions containing excess levels of the free enzyme, is illustrated for the efficient biocatalytic degradation of phenolic and azo-type pollutants. The high efficiency of the motor-based decontamination approach makes it extremely attractive for a wide-range of remediation processes in the environmental, defense and public health fields. Keep the motor running: Catalytic degradation of pollutants by enzyme-releasing motors is reported. The first example of a self-propelled tubular motor that releases an enzyme in a controlled fashion for the efficient biocatalytic degradation of chemical pollutants is described (see figure). {\textcopyright} 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

By a stability analysis of the field theory, we obtain equations for the spinodal that describes the onset of a motility-induced instability leading to cluster formation in such mixtures. The prediction for the spinodal is found to be in good agreement with particle-resolved computer simulations. Furthermore, we show that in active-passive mixtures the spinodal instability can be of two different types. One type is associated with a stationary bifurcation and occurs also in one-component active systems, whereas the other type is associated with a Hopf bifurcation and can occur only in active-passive mixtures. Remarkably, the Hopf bifurcation leads to moving clusters. This explains recent results from simulations of active-passive particle mixtures, where moving clusters and interfaces that are not seen in the corresponding one-component systems have been observed.},

@article{Andreas1938,
abstract = {New work has demonstrated that the method of pendant drops provides a means for measuring either surface tension or interfacial tension which gives precise results under the most difficult conditions. The mathematical theory of the shape of static liquid drops is revised, and new methods are developed by which the boundary tension can be computed readily from a knowledge of the specific gravities of the liquids which are to be tested and from simple measurements made on a photograph which shows the silhouette of a hanging drop. The construction of apparatus is discussed. With the equipment and empirical function now available, the method gives results which are comparable in speed and accuracy to the best obtainable by standard methods. With the present apparatus, the results have a probable error of about ± 0.5 per cent. The method is potentially capable of giving results accurate to ± 0.05 per cent. Future improvement depends upon a more precise determination of the mathematical function connecting drop shape with boundary tension and upon the construction of special, high-precision equipment. The method has the following outstanding advantages: (1) It is sufficiently simple to be subjected to a complete mathematical analysis. (2) The results are independent of the angle of contact between the fluid interface and the apparatus. (3) The method is static and is therefore not influenced by viscosity effects. (4) Measurements are made instantaneously. (5) Successive measurements can be made of a given surface without disturbing it, thus permitting an accurate study of the aging of surfaces. (6) Boundary tensions of any magnitude can be observed. Values as great as 370 dynes and as small as 0.3 dyne per centimeter were measured with the present apparatus. (7) Either surface tension or interfacial tension can be measured in any system in which at least one fluid is transparent and the fluids are of unequal density. (8) Only small samples are required. One cubic centimeter of the internal phase is usually more than enough for several measurements. (9) The apparatus is adapted to simple temperature control. (10) The photographs on which the measurements are made serve as permanent records. Typical measurements are presented which show that: (1) The results are in agreement with those determined by standard methods and published in the literature. (2) The method gives self-consistent results for the boundary tensions of a great variety of liquid systems, of which some have not been reported previously. (3) The presence of surface-active materials can have a tremendous effect on the boundary tension, and liquid-liquid interfaces are relatively more affected by surface-active materials than are liquid-gas interfaces. (4) Boundary tensions may either increase or decrease during the aging of an interface. Preliminary suggestions as to the possible reasons for the observed phenomena are offered. The results so far obtained justify the belief that the method of pendant drops will prove to be of special value in studying the boundary tensions of (1) viscous liquids, (2) surface-active solutions, (3) small samples of rare chemicals, and (4) systems in which the contact angle is not zero.},

Though the correct equation of state is not known, its presumed homogeneity of form is alone sufficient to allow most features of the interface to be determined explicitly. In particular, the maximum density gradient in the interface, the asymptotic behavior of the interface profile at large distances from the position of its maximum gradient, and the surface tension, are each obtained up to a dimensionless, and presumably universal, proportionality constant that reflects only the functional form of the equation of state. Numerical evaluation of the surface tension requires a knowledge of the limits approached by the correlation length and compressibility in the homogeneous fluid as the phase transition pomt is approached. These are only imperfectly known, so the surface tension calculated from the theory is subject to some uncertainty, but within its limits of uncertainty it is in agreement with experiment.},

Here we develop a simple mechanical theory to study the phase behavior and "temperature" of a mixture of self-propelled particles. A mixture of active swimmers and passive Brownian particles is an ideal system for discovery of the temperature of active matter and the quantities that get shared upon particle collisions. We derive an explicit equation of state for the active/passive mixture to compute a phase diagram and to generalize thermodynamic concepts like the chemical potential and free energy for a mixture of nonequilibrium species.

abstract = {We simulate a model of self-propelled disks with soft repulsive interactions confined to a box in two dimensions. For small rotational diffusion rates, monodisperse disks spontaneously accumulate at the walls. At low densities, interaction forces between particles are strongly inhomogeneous, and a simple model predicts how these inhomogeneities alter the equation of state. At higher densities, collective effects become important. We observe signatures of a jamming transition at a packing fraction ∼ 0.88, which is also the jamming point for non-active athermal monodisperse disks. At this , the system develops a critical finite active speed necessary for wall aggregation. At packing fractions above ∼ 0.6, the pressure decreases with increasing density, suggesting that strong interactions between particles are affecting the equation of state well below the jamming transition. A mixture of bidisperse disks segregates in the absence of any adhesion, identifying a new mechanism that could contribute to cell sorting in embryonic development.

abstract = {This paper describes osmotically-driven pressure generation in a membrane-bound compartment while taking into account volume expansion, solute dilution, surface area to volume ratio, membrane hydraulic permeability, and changes in osmotic gradient, bulk modulus, and degree of membrane fouling. The emphasis lies on the dynamics of pressure generation; these dynamics have not previously been described in detail. Experimental results are compared to and supported by numerical simulations, which we make accessible as an open source tool. This approach reveals unintuitive results about the quantitative dependence of the speed of pressure generation on the relevant and interdependent parameters that will be encountered in most osmotically-driven pressure generators. For instance, restricting the volume expansion of a compartment allows it to generate its first 5 kPa of pressure seven times faster than without a restraint. In addition, this dynamics study shows that plants are near-ideal osmotic pressure generators, as they are composed of many small compartments with large surface area to volume ratios and strong cell wall reinforcements.

Both applications do not need an external power source but rather take advantage of the energy released upon watering the pressure generators. {\textcopyright} 2014 Bruhn et al.},

abstract = {We investigate motility-induced phase separation of active Brownian particles, which are modeled as purely repulsive spheres that move due to a constant swim force with freely diffusing orientation. We develop on the basis of power functional concepts an analytical theory for nonequilibrium phase coexistence and interfacial structure. Theoretical predictions are validated against Brownian dynamics computer simulations. We show that the internal one-body force field has four nonequilibrium contributions: (i) isotropic drag and (ii) interfacial drag forces against the forward motion, (iii) a superadiabatic spherical pressure gradient, and (iv) the quiet life gradient force. The intrinsic spherical pressure is balanced by the swim pressure, which arises from the polarization of the free interface. The quiet life force opposes the adiabatic force, which is due to the inhomogeneous density distribution. The balance of quiet life and adiabatic forces determines bulk coexistence via equality of two bulk state functions, which are independent of interfacial contributions. The internal force fields are kinematic functionals which depend on density and current but are independent of external and swim forces, consistent with power functional theory. The phase transition originates from nonequilibrium repulsion, with the agile gas being more repulsive than the quiet liquid.},

abstract = {Nanotherapies based on micelles, liposomes, polymersomes, nanocapsules, magnetic nanoparticles, and noble metal nanoparticles have been at the forefront of drug delivery in the past few decades. Some of these nanopharmaceuticals have been commercially applied to treat a wide range of diseases, from dry eye syndrome to cancer. However, the majority involve particles that are passive, meaning that they do not change shape, and they lack motility; the static features can limit their therapeutic efficacy. In this review, we take a critical look at an emerging field that seeks to utilize active matter for therapeutics. In this context, active matter can be broadly referred to as micro or nanosized constructs that energetically react with their environment or external fields and translate, rotate, vibrate or change shape. Essentially, the recent literature suggests that such particles could significantly augment present-day drug delivery, by enhancing transport and increasing permeability across anatomical barriers by transporting drugs within solid tumor microenvironments or disrupting cardiovascular plaque. We discuss examples of such particles and link the transport and permeability properties of active matter to potential therapeutic applications in the context of two major diseases, namely cancer and heart disease. We also discuss potential challenges, opportunities, and translational hurdles.},

Applications of time reversal mirrors (TRMs) in hydrodynamics are then presented in section 3. Section 4 is devoted to the application of TRMs in pulse echo detection. A complete theory of the iterative time reversal mode is presented. It will be explained how this technique allows for focusing on different targets in a multi-target medium. Another application of pulse echo TRMs is presented in this section: how to achieve resonance in an elastic target?

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the effects that density fluctuations in different regions of a liquid-vapor interface have on the interfacial thermodynamic and structural properties. The total volume V is divided into a square array of columns whose width is the order of the bulk correlation length. The canonical partition function is written as a sum of constrained partition functions, each describing a system with a given number of particles in each column. Changes in the occupation number of each column (i.e., density fluctuations) are related to changes in position of the local Gibbs dividing surface, and the free energy of such distortions of the Gibbs surface is estimated using macroscopic ideas similar to those used in the capillary wave theory of Buff, Lovett, and Stillinger. Corrections to the interface tension as calculated for a single column with periodic boundary conditions are given. We make a self-consistent choice of the column width which yields a scaling law originally proposed by Widom. Fluctuations in position of the local Gibbs surfaces of widely separated columns cause the total interface width to depend on the system size and strength of an external field while the local width in a single column is proportional to the bulk correlation length. These fluctuations also cause the very long-ranged correlations parallel to the interface predicted by Wertheim. Both the singlet and the pair distributions functions are calculated. An extension of Wertheim's analysis is given. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1977 American Institute of Physics.},

This approach allows us to identify that, despite its non-equilibrium nature, the equations of state of Active Brownian Particles (ABP) across MIPS verify the characteristic properties of first-order liquid-gas phase transitions, meaning, equality of pressure of the coexisting phases once a nucleation barrier has been overcome and, in the opposite case, hysteresis around the transition as long as the system remains in the metastable region.

@article{Zia2012,
abstract = {In active, nonlinear microrheology, a Brownian "probe" particle is driven through a complex fluid and its motion tracked in order to infer the mechanical properties of the embedding material. In the absence of external forcing, the probe and background particles form an equilibrium microstructure that fluctuates thermally. Probe motion through the medium distorts the microstructure; the character of this deformation, and hence its influence on probe motion, depends on the strength with which the probe is forced, F-ext, compared to thermal forces, kT/b, defining a Peclet number, Pe = F-ext/(kT/b), where kT is the thermal energy and b is the characteristic microstructural length scale. Recent studies showed that the mean probe speed can be interpreted as the effective material viscosity, whereas fluctuations in probe velocity give rise to an anisotropic force-induced diffusive spread of its trajectory. The viscosity and diffusivity can thus be obtained by two simple quantities-mean and mean-square displacement of the probe. The notion that diffusive flux is driven by stress gradients leads to the idea that the stress can be related directly to the microdiffusivity, and thus the anisotropy of the diffusion tensor reflects the presence of normal stress differences in nonlinear microrheology. In this study, a connection is made between diffusion and stress gradients, and a relation between the particle-phase stress and the diffusivity and viscosity is derived for a probe particle moving through a colloidal dispersion. This relation is shown to agree with two standard micromechanical definitions of the stress, suggesting that the normal stresses and normal stress differences can be measured in nonlinear microrheological experiments if both the mean and mean-square motion of the probe are monitored. Owing to the axisymmetry of the motion about a spherical probe, the second normal stress difference is zero, while the first normal stress difference is linear in Pe for Pe {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 1 and vanishes as Pe(4) for Pe {\textless}{\textless} 1. The expression obtained for stress-induced migration can be viewed as a generalized nonequilibrium Stokes-Einstein relation. A final connection is made between the stress and an "effective temperature" of the medium, prompting the interpretation of the particle stress as the energy density, and the expression for osmotic pressure as a "nonequilibrium equation of state."

With these ingredients we show that it is possible to develop a statistical mechanical approach similar to the one employed in the study of equilibrium liquids and to obtain the explicit form of the many-particle distribution function by means of the multidimensional unified colored noise approximation. Such a distribution plays a role analogous to the Gibbs distribution in equilibrium statistical mechanics and provides complete information about the microscopic state of the system. From here we develop a method to determine the one- and two-particle distribution functions in the spirit of the Born-Green-Yvon (BGY) equations of equilibrium statistical mechanics. The resulting equations which contain extra-correlations induced by the activity allow us to determine the stationary density profiles in the presence of external fields, the pair correlations and the pressure of active fluids. In the low density regime we obtained the effective pair potential $\Phi$(r) acting between two isolated particles separated by a distance, r, showing the existence of an effective attraction between them induced by activity. Based on these results, in the second half of the paper we propose a mean field theory as an approach simpler than the BGY hierarchy and use it to derive a van der Waals expression of the equation of state.},

abstract = {We study the free diffusion in two dimensions of active Brownian swimmers subject to passive fluctuations on the translational motion and to active fluctuations on the rotational one. The Smoluchowski equation is derived from a Langevin-like model of active swimmers and analytically solved in the long-time regime for arbitrary values of the P{\'{e}}clet number; this allows us to analyze the out-of-equilibrium evolution of the positions distribution of active particles at all time regimes. Explicit expressions for the mean-square displacement and for the kurtosis of the probability distribution function are presented and the effects of persistence discussed. We show through Brownian dynamics simulations that our prescription for the mean-square displacement gives the exact time dependence at all times. The departure of the probability distribution from a Gaussian, measured by the kurtosis, is also analyzed both analytically and computationally. We find that for the inverse of P{\'{e}}clet numbers ≲0.1, the distance from Gaussian increases as ∼t{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} at short times, while it diminishes as ∼t{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in the asymptotic limit.},

The IB formulation of such problems, derived here from the principle of least action, involves both Eulerian and Lagrangian variables, linked by the Dirac delta function. Spatial discretization of the IB equations is based on a fixed Cartesian mesh for the Eulerian variables, and a moving curvilinear mesh for the Lagrangian variables. The two types of variables are linked by interaction equations that involve a smoothed approximation to the Dirac delta function. Eulerian/Lagrangian identities govern the transfer of data from one mesh to the other. Temporal discretization is by a second-order Runge-Kutta method. Current and future research directions are pointed out, and applications of the IB method are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Our simulations on ABPs show good agreement with our Fokker-Planck calculations, and confirm that is spatially constant for several inhomogeneous active fluids in their steady states in a planar geometry. Finally, we show that phase coexistence of ABPs with a planar interface satisfies not only mechanical but also diffusive equilibrium. The coexistence can be well-described by equating the bulk chemical potential and bulk pressure obtained from bulk simulations for systems with low activity but requires explicit evaluation of the interfacial contributions at high activity.},

Barab si and Stanley explain how fractals can be successfully used to describe and predict the morphology of surface growth. The authors begin by presenting basic growth models and the principles used to develop them. They next demonstrate how models can be used to answer specific questions about surface roughness. In the second half of the book, they discuss in detail two classes of phenomena: fluid flow in porous media and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). In each case, the authors review the model and analytical approach, and present experimental results. This book is the first attempt to unite the subjects of fractals and surfaces, and it will appeal to advanced undergraduate and graduate students in condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics. Because of the technological importance of MBE, it will also be of interest to scientists, particularly materials scientists, working in industry and research.

abstract = {We discuss different definitions of pressure for a system of active spherical particles driven by a non-thermal coloured noise. We show that mechanical, kinetic and free-energy based approaches lead to the same result up to first order in the non-equilibrium expansion parameter. The first prescription is based on a generalisation of the kinetic mesoscopic virial equation and expresses the pressure exerted on the walls in terms of the average of the virial of the inter-particle forces. In the second approach, the pressure and the surface tension are identified with the volume and area derivatives, respectively, of the partition function associated with the known stationary non-equilibrium distribution of the model. The third method is a mechanical approach and is related to the work necessary to deform the system. The pressure is obtained by comparing the expression of the work in terms of local stress and strain with the corresponding expression in terms of microscopic distribution. This is determined from the force balance encoded in the Born-Green-Yvon equation. Such a method has the advantage of giving a formula for the local pressure tensor and the surface tension even in inhomogeneous situations. By direct inspection, we show that the three procedures lead to the same values of the pressure, and give support to the idea that the partition function, obtained via the unified coloured noise approximation, is more than a formal property of the system, but determines the stationary non-equilibrium thermodynamics of the model.},

Conversely, the theory may be used to construct the box shape that yields any desired density distribution on the boundary, thus offering a general tool to understand and design such confinements. When the curvature variations are small, we also predict the distribution of orientations at the boundary and the exponential decay of pressure as a function of box size recently observed in simulations in a spherical box.

The propelled particles exert a net reaction force on the solvent, and thereby either drive a measurable solvent flow from the connecting solvent reservoir through the semipermeable membrane, or increase the osmotic pressure and cause the suspension to rise to heights as large as micrometers for experimentally realized microswimmers described in the literature. The increase in osmotic pressure is caused by the background solvent being, in contrast to passive suspensions, no longer at the chemical potential of the solvent reservoir. The difference in solvent chemical potentials depends on the colloid-membrane interaction potential, which implies that the osmotic pressure is a state function of a state that itself is influenced by the membrane potential.},

A new catalytic polymer/Ni/Pt microtube engine, containing carboxy moieties on its mixed poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)/COOH-PEDOT polymeric outermost layer, is further functionalized with the antibody receptor to selectively recognize and capture the target protein. The new motor-based microchip immunoassay operations are carried out without any bulk fluid flow, replacing the common washing steps in antibody-based protein bioassays with the active transport of the captured protein throughout the different reservoirs, where each step of the immunoassay takes place. A first microchip format involving an 'on-the-fly' double-antibody sandwich assay (DASA) is used for demonstrating the selective capture of the target protein, in the presence of excess of non-target proteins. A secondary antibody tagged with a polymeric-sphere tracer allows the direct visualization of the binding events. In a second approach the immuno-nanomotor captures and transports the microsphere-tagged antigen through a microchannel network. An anti-protein-A modified microengine is finally used to demonstrate the selective capture, transport and convenient label-free optical detection of a Staphylococcus aureus target bacteria (containing proteinA in its cell wall) in the presence of a large excess of non-target (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells. The resulting nanomotor-based microchip immunoassay offers considerable potential for diverse applications in clinical diagnostics, environmental and security monitoring fields. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

The swelling behavior, reduced with respect to PNIPAM and water, has been described by the Flory-Rehner theory, tested for PNIPAM microgel and successfully expanded to higher order for IPN microgels. Moreover the concentration dependence of the relaxation time at neutral pH has highlighted two different routes to approach the glass transition: Arrhenius and super-Arrhenius (Vogel Fulcher Tammann) respectively below and above the VPT and a fragility plot has been derived. Fragility can be tuned by changing temperature: across the VPT particles undergo a transition from soft-strong to stiff-fragile.},

abstract = {The optoelectronic properties of macromolecular semiconductors depend fundamentally on their solid-state microstructure. For example, the molecular-weight distribution influences polymeric- semiconductor properties via diverse microstructures; polymers of low weight-average molecular weight (Mw) form unconnected, extended-chain crystals, usually of a paraffinic structure. Because of the non-entangled nature of the relatively short-chain macromolecules, this leads to a polycrystalline, one-phase morphology. In contrast, with high-Mw materials, where average chain lengths are longer than the length between entanglements, two-phase morphologies, comprised of crystalline moieties embedded in largely unordered (amorphous) regions, are obtained. We investigate charge photogeneration processes in neat regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) of varying Mw by means of time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. At 10 K, PL originating from recombination of long-lived charge pairs decays over microsecond timescales. Both the amplitude and decay rate distribution depend strongly on Mw. In films with dominant one-phase chain-extended microstructures, the delayed PL is suppressed as a result of a diminished yield of photoinduced charges, and its decay is significantly faster than in two-phase microstructures. However, independent of Mw, charge recombination regenerates singlet excitons in torsionally disordered chains forming more strongly coupled photophysical aggregates than those in the steady-state ensemble, with delayed PL lineshape reminiscent of that in paraffinic morphologies at steady state. We conclude that highly delocalized excitons in disordered regions between crystalline and amorphous phases dissociate extrinsically with yield and spatial distribution that depend intimately upon microstructure.},

@article{Mallory2020,
abstract = {By introducing the notion of a dynamic overlap concentration scale, we identify universal and previously unreported features of the mechanical properties of active colloids. These features are codified by recognizing that the characteristic length scale of an active particle's trajectory, the run-length, introduces a new concentration scale {\$}\backslashphi{\^{}}*{\$}. Large-scale simulations of repulsive active Brownian particles (ABPs) confirm that this new run-length dependent concentration, which is the trajectory-space analogue of the overlap concentration in polymer solutions, delineates distinct concentration regimes in which interparticle collisions alter particle trajectories. Using {\$}\backslashphi{\^{}}*{\$} and concentration scales associated with colloidal jamming, the mechanical equation-of-state for ABPs can be collapsed onto a set of principal curves that contain a number of previously overlooked features. The inclusion of these features qualitatively alters previous predictions of the behavior for active colloids as we demonstrate by computing the spinodal for a suspension of purely-repulsive ABPs. Our findings suggest that dynamic overlap concentration scales should be of great utility in unraveling the behavior of active and driven systems.},

@article{Patch2018,
abstract = {Purely repulsive active particles spontaneously undergo motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) into condensed and dilute phases. Remarkably, the mechanical tension measured along the interface between these phases is negative. In equilibrium this would imply an unstable interface that wants to expand, but these out-of-equilibrium systems display long-time stability and have intrinsically stiff boundaries. Here, we study this phenomenon in detail using active Brownian particle simulations and a novel frame of reference. By shifting from the global (or laboratory) frame to a local frame that follows the dynamics of the phase boundary, we observe correlations between the local curvature of the interface and the measured value of the tension. Importantly, our analysis reveals that curvature drives sustained local tangential motion of particles within a surface layer in both the gas and the dense regions. The combined tangential current in the gas and local "self-shearing" of the surface of the dense phase suggest a stiffening interface that redirects particles along itself to heal local fluctuations. These currents restore the otherwise wildly fluctuating interface through an out-of-equilibrium Marangoni effect. We discuss the implications of our observations on phenomenological models of interfacial dynamics.},

@article{Hoff1995,
abstract = {In the course of an investigation which aimed chiefly at the acquisition of knowledge regarding the laws that regulate chemical equilibrium in solution 2, it gradually appeared that there is a fundamental analogy, nay almost an identity, with gases, more especially in their physical aspect, if only in solutions we consider the so-called osmotic pressure instead of the ordinary gaseous pressure. This analogy will be made evident as far as possible in the following memoir, physical properties being first considered. I. Osmotic pressure. Nature of the analogy arising from its introduction To gain in the first place a theoretical notion of the magnitude which will be chiefly dealt with in what follows, let us imagine a vessel A, completely filled with, say, an aqueous solution of sugar, and itself immersed in water B. If now the perfectly unyielding wall of the vessel is permeable to water and imperme-able to the sugar dissolved in it, it is known that the attraction of the solution for water will cause water to enter into A, a process which will, however, soon come to an end through the pressure generated by the entry of a small amount of water. Under these circumstances there is equilibrium, and the pressure which will be exerted on the wall of the vessel we shall call in what follows osmotic pressure.},

@article{Ford2017,
abstract = {A system in equilibrium will in general exhibit microscopic fluctuations about the equilibrium state. The fluctuation–dissipation theorem relates the spectrum of these fluctuations to a solution of the macroscopic equation describing the approach to equilibrium from a non-equilibrium state. The aim here is to show exactly what the theorem is and how it is to be used. An account of the quantum version of the theorem is given in three parts, depending on the solution of the macroscopic equation used to express the fluctuations: the relaxation function, the response function or the Green function for continuous systems. Each part is illustrated with an example: charge fluctuations in an RLC circuit for the first two and electric field fluctuations in vacuum for the last.},

@article{Solon2015a,
abstract = {Pressure is the mechanical force per unit area that a confined system exerts on its container. In thermal equilibrium, it depends only on bulk properties - such as density and temperature - through an equation of state. Here we show that in a wide class of active systems the pressure depends on the precise interactions between the active particles and the confining walls. In general, therefore, active fluids have no equation of state. Their mechanical pressure exhibits anomalous properties that defy the familiar thermodynamic reasoning that holds in equilibrium. The pressure remains a function of state, however, in some specific and well-studied active models that tacitly restrict the character of the particle-wall and/or particle-particle interactions.},

@article{Evans1979,
abstract = {Recent theoretical work on the microscopic structure and surface tension of the liquid-vapour interface of simple (argon-like) fluids is critically reviewed. In particular, the form of pairwise intermolecular correlations in the liquid surface and the capillary wave treatment of the interface are examined in some detail. It is argued that conventional capillary wave theory, which leads to divergences in the width of the density profile, is unsatisfactory for describing all the equilibrium aspects of the interface. The density functional formalism which has been developed to study the liquid-vapour interface can also be profitably applied to other problems in the statistical mechanics of non-uniform fluids; here a new generalization of the ‘linear' theory of spinodal decomposition is formulated and by considering a ‘nearly uniform' fluid, some useful results for the long-wavelength behaviour of the liquid structure factor of various monatomic liquids are obtained. Some other topics of current interest in this area are briefly discussed. {\textcopyright} Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},
