                            <p style="font-size: 1.0rem" class="about__text"> During the COVID pandemic, I founded the <a href="https://aps.unc.edu/gsa-in-the-department-of-applied-physical-sciences-helps-build-graduate-student-community/">Graduate Student Association</a> to keep students connected and advocate for graduate student interests in key departmental decisions.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p style="font-size: 1.0rem" class="about__text"> Since its founding in 2020, GSA planned and hosted countless intra- and inter-departmental social events, professional development seminars, and outreach opportunities. Successes include volunteering at the North Carolina Science Festival to share the science being done within our department, becoming officially recognized as a student organization by UNC in 2022, and adjusting the Materials Science PhD curriculum and requirements to best suit our students goals. </p>
